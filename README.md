# Budget Matrix

Budget Matrix is a simple expense tracking and budget management web app built with React and Vite. It helps users add income and expense transactions, track totals, view remaining budget, and keep data saved in the browser with localStorage.

## About The Project

This project is designed to make money tracking easy and clear. Users can log transactions, filter them by type, remove unwanted entries, and review a clean dashboard with summary cards. The app also includes a login page for a demo sign-in flow and simple content pages for Home, About, Contact, and Coming Soon.

The design uses a warm amber and violet theme with Tailwind CSS and keeps the UI clean, readable, and responsive.

## Features

- Add income and expense transactions.
- Save transactions in localStorage.
- Delete transactions from the list.
- Filter transactions by All, Income, or Expense.
- View total income, total expenses, remaining budget, and savings rate.
- Demo login page with fixed username and password.
- Logout button on the dashboard that returns the user to Home.
- Coming Soon page for future feature ideas and suggestions.
- Responsive pages with a consistent theme.
- Footer links for company and legal pages.

## Demo Login
